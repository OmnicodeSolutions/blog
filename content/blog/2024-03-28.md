Today is Thursday, day 088 of 366 (24.04%). We're in week 13 of 52 (25.00%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] Learn React

## Activities executed

Today I continued the [React course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8).

I also [updated the blog's title](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/issues/147) because it was still with Adidoks default.

## Learnings

Today the course covered a lot of CSS and atyling and I learned about props and how to make my functions acctually reusable in the components.
