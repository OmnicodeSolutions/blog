Today is Tuesday, day 297 of 365 (81.36%). We're in week 43 of 52 (82.69%). 

## Planning

What I am going to do today: 

- [x] [finish Flutter set up](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor?tab=vscode)

## Activities executed

Today I finished setting up Flutter and created a [git repository](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/flutter_codelab) to work on the [flutter codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first?hl=pt-br#0). I also updated [ansible-debian](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/ansible-debian) to include the Flutter configuration.

## Learnings

Today I learned how to use tags to select wich tasks an ansible playbook to run with:
```
  ansible-playbook [file_path] --tags [tags]
```
