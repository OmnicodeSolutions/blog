Today is Thursday, day 102 of 366 (27.86%). We're in week 15 of 52 (28.84%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] [work on link to blog in Omnicode's website](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/website/issues/119)
- [x] [start working on adding a map to Omnicode's website](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/website/issues/128)

## Activities executed

Today I removed an unecessary logic from the blog link in the website and started working on a new issue, which is to add a map with the company's location to the website. I found what looked like a [good tempalte](https://www.andrewl.net/article/gatsby-geo-simple-map), but I'm having trouble including it. 

First, I got this error:

```bash
Uncaught Error: Cannot find module 'react'
```

Which looked very stringe, so I looked it up and saw someone saying that they bumped into it after installing a couple plugins - which I had just done to add the map. The person said that running `npm install` fixed it, so I id that and it did fix that problem, but it showed another error:

```bash
yarn run v1.22.4
$ gatsby develop
The above error occurred in the <StoreStateProvider> component: in StoreStateProvider in App
```

that looks even more weird because it tells me literally nothing. So I looked it up and found someone else saing that this usually happens because of a mismatch of React and the underlying Gatsby version that may have been previously installed in the application. I tried a few things, but what ultimatly solved it was:

1. removing `node_modlues`
2. removing `package-lock.json`
3. removing `yarn.json`
4. running `npm install` (I stop using yarn)

Now, the website builds, but the map doesn't work, so that's what I'll be working on tomorrow.

## Learnings

Today I learned that to run the gatsby site with npm you use:

```bash
npm run-script build
```
