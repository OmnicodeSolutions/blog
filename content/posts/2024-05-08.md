Today is Wednesday, day 129 of 366 (35.24%). We're in week 19 of 52 (36.53%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] [Finish translating the website](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/website/issues/101)
- [x] [Start working on the toggle language button](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/website/issues/101)

## Activities executed

Today I finally finished translating 100% of the website. The method for the legal pages was the same as I used for the services pages, so this part was quite fast.

After I finished the translation, I started working on the toggle button. I first made a simple button to toggle between the two languages we currently have. To do that, I used the `lang` and `originalPath` variables that `usePageContext()` from the theme intl plugin provides. All I had to do was navigate to the same original path, but with the other language:

```js
<Link to={"/" + (lang === 'pt' ? "en" : "pt") + originalPath}>
    <li>
        {lang === 'pt' ? <img src={brazil} alt="usa flag" width="40" /> : <img src={usa} alt="brazil flag" width="40" />}
    </li>
</Link>
```

It worked fine, but then Mauricio said he wanted it to be a dropdown so that we could easily add more languages when necessary. Adding the dropdown itself was not hard; the thing is I cannot for the life of me figure out how to change the current URL once I select a different language. I already tried a lot of different functions, but nothing seems to work when I put it in the `onChange` parameter. The most promising one I found was `this.props.history.push("path")`, but I just can't get it to work.

## Readings

I found this nice [GitHub repo](https://github.com/HatScripts/circle-flags?tab=readme-ov-file) that has almost every country's flag in a nice round simplified design svg icon.
