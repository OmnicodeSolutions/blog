Today is Thursday, day 109 of 366 (29.78%). We're in week 16 of 52 (30.76%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] [Add the website's content to new Gatsby project](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/website/issues/131)

## Activities executed

Today, I started by trying to fix yesterday's remark error. I spent a long time trying to figure out what was going wrong and read a lot of GitHub repos, but everything looked fine. Running `gatsby build` kept getting this warning:

```bash
warn ./src/components/hero.js
Attempted import error: 'remark' does not contain a default export (imported as 'remark').
```
So, I thought it had something to do with it. I did a little research and saw that in this case I have to put what I want to import in curly braces, but that didn't do it. A while later, I decided to just run `gatsby serve` to see if what was going on the page would help me figure out the code, and when I opened it, the images were all wrong. I went to GitHub to take a look at the branches and saw a `develop` branch with the right images, so I asked Mauricio if he was sure the branch I should copy the content from was `production` and not `develop`, and he said it was `develop`. After I replaced all the wrong content, added a few missing plugins and directories, I got the same remark error, but changing the imports fixed it this time.

I did notice some deprecation warnings when running `gatsby build`, so I'll be working on that and adding the rest of the content tomorrow.
