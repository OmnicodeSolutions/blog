Today is Monday, day 120 of 366 (32.78%). We're in week 18 of 52 (34.61%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] [Make website multilingual](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/website/issues/101)

## Activities executed

Today I was able to make the website multilingual. On Monday, I found out that the creator of the [tutorial](https://itnext.io/techniques-approaches-for-multi-language-gatsby-apps-8ba13ff433c5) I was following also made [plugins](https://github.com/3nvi/gatsby-intl/) to help implement multi-language Gatsby apps. I chose to give `gatsby-theme-intl` a try since it's recommended to integrate i18n for the first time into an existing Gatsby app. It took me a while to get it to work, but in the end, you have to:

1. Install `gatsby-plugin-intl` (the `gatsby-theme-intl` composes it):

```bash
npm i @3nvi/gatsby-plugin-intl
```

PS: `gatsby-plugin-intl` depends on `react-helmet`, so you also need to have that installed.

2. Install `gatsby-theme-intl`:

```bash
npm i @3nvi/gatsby-theme-intl
```

3. Create an `i18n.json` file that will hold all your translations:

```json
{
    "en": {
        "translations": {
            //your translations for "en" language
        }
    },
    "pt": {
        "translations": {
            //your translations for "pt" language
        }
    }
    //add as many languages as you need
}
```

4. Access your translations file from `gatsby-config.js`:

``` js
const translations = require('./i18n.json');
```

5. Configure `gatsby-theme-intl` in `gatsby-config.js`:

```js
{
    resolve: `@3nvi/gatsby-theme-intl`,
    options: {
        supportedLanguages: ["en", "pt"],
        defaultLanguage: "en",
        i18nextConfig: {
            resources: translations,
        },
    },
},
```

After setting everything up, you can access your translations from any `.js` component using:

```js
import { useTranslation } from @3nvi/gatsby-theme-intl

const { t } = useTranslations

export default function Component() {
    return (
        <h1>{t("title")}</h1>
        <p>{t("description.name")}</p>
    )
}
```

In this case, you would need a `"title"` key with the title and a `"description"` key with a `"name"` key in your `i18n.json` file, so it would look something like this:

```json
{
    "en": {
        "translations": {
            "title": "Component Title ",
            "description": {
                "name": "Jane Doe"
            }
        }
    },
    "pt": {
        "translations": {
            "title": //...
        }
    }
    //...
}
```

I was able to implement most translations on the website; the only things missing are the dropdown button options in the contact section and the header buttons.

## Learnings

Today I learned how to use the `gatsby-theme-intl` plugin to make a Gatsby app multilingual.
