Today is Friday, day 096 of 366 (26.22%). We're in week 14 of 52 (26.92%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] [Watch React course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8)

## Activities executed

Today I continued watching the React course.

## Learnings

Today I finished chapter 3 of the course. I learned about the `useEffect` function and how to handle side effects when accessing things outside React (APIs, websockets, etc.)
