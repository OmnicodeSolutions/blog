Today is Thursday, day 116 of 366 (31.69%). We're in week 17 of 52 (32.69%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] Fix GitHub action
- [x] [Start working on the website's translation](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/website/issues/101)

## Activities executed

Today I was able to get the updated website to pass GitHub actions. Mauricio helped me realize that I was missing a few things in the `packages.json` file:

```json
"scripts": {
    "build": "gatsby build",
    "develop": "gatsby develop",
    "format": "prettier --write \"**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,json,md,scss}\"",
    "start": "yarn run develop",
    "serve": "gatsby serve",
    "clean": "gatsby clean",
    "lint": "prettier --check \"**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,json,md,scss}\"",
    "test": "echo \"Write tests! -> https://gatsby.dev/unit-testing\" && exit 1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "prettier": "2.0.5"
  }
```

All I had to do was add those.

I also started working on making the website translatable. I'm following [this tutorial](https://itnext.io/techniques-approaches-for-multi-language-gatsby-apps-8ba13ff433c5), and everything was running fine until I added the `pageContext.js` file, and it started giving me this error:

```bash
 ERROR  UNKNOWN

Truncated page data information for the failed page "/legal/privacy-policy/": {
  "errors": {},
  "path": "/legal/privacy-policy/",
  "slicesMap": {},
  "pageContext": {
    "slug": "/legal/privacy-policy/"
  }
}

failed Building static HTML for pages - 2.179s

 ERROR #95313  HTML.COMPILATION

Building static HTML failed for path "/legal/privacy-policy/"

See our docs page for more info on this error: https://gatsby.dev/debug-html


   6 | export const PageContextProvider = ({ pageContext, children }) => {
   7 |   const { i18n } = useTranslation();
>  8 |   i18n.changeLanguage(pageContext.lang);
     |                                   ^
   9 |
  10 |   return <PageContext.Provider value={pageContext}>{children}</PageContext.Provider>;
  11 | };


  WebpackError: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'lang')
```

It says the error occurs on multiple pages, and by the looks of it, I believe I have to define the `lang` variable on each page. I'm just not sure how since the tutorial doesn't specify that. I wasn't able to really dig into trying to solve this, but I don't think it's anything too complicated, which means I can try to get the translation logic done by tomorrow.

## Learnings

Today I learned about the [i18next internationalization-framework](https://www.i18next.com/) that provides plurals, context, interpolation, format, and much more.
