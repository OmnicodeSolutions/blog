Today is Monday, day 134 of 366 (36.61%). We're in week 20 of 52 (38.46%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] [Continue research for the tax invoice project](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/scanspend/issues/1)
- [x] [Study architecture of apps](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/scanspend/issues/3)

## Activities executed

Today I [studied the technologies](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/scanspend/blob/libraries/docs/typescriptApp.md) used by [this TypeScript app](https://github.com/SOS-RS) and tried to find some JavaScript/TypeScript libraries to handle tax invoices, but could only find one, it gets information from the `xml` file like the Dart one I found.
