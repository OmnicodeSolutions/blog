Today is Wednesday, day 150 of 366 (40.98%). We're in week 22 of 52 (42.30%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] Finish internship report with LLMs

## Activities executed

Today I finally finished the report. I completed [`create_report.py`'s `main` function](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/blob/ec32a86f3a6e784726892180c614af692baa2878/internship_report/create_report.py#L46C1-L73C24) and did some minor adjustments to [`ingest_data.py`](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/blob/ec32a86f3a6e784726892180c614af692baa2878/internship_report/ingest_data.py#L1C1-L35C39) and [`query_data.py`](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/blob/ec32a86f3a6e784726892180c614af692baa2878/internship_report/query_data.py#L1C1-L43C26). In the first one I aded an `if` clause to check if the Chroma client already has a collection and delete it if it does, whitout this I would get an error saying the `en_posts` collection already existed when `create_report.py` had to make more than one call to `create_report_from_blog`.

I do want to change one thing: currently `create_report.py` checks if the elapsed time between the start date and the date limit is greater than 3 months, but I use 90 days to split the trimesters (which means the dates from a report are not always form only three months) so I think I should check for the elapsed days instead of the months to make the code more cohesive.
