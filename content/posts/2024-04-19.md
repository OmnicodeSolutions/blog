Today is Friday, day 110 of 366 (30.05%). We're in week 16 of 52 (30.76%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] [Copy remaining files to new Gatsby project](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/website/issues/131)
- [x] [Fix deprecation warnings](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/website/issues/131)

## Activities executed

Today, I finished upgrading Gatsby and Node! Everything from the old website works perfectly on the new one. I finished copying all the missing files, hit a few errors, but nothing I hadn't fixed before already, and then I dealt with the deprecation warnings. There is one last one that I just saw, which is this:

```bash
warn Browserslist: caniuse-lite is outdated. Please run:
  npx update-browserslist-db@latest
  Why you should do it regularly: https://github.com/browserslist/update-db#readme
```

It doesn't seem too big of a deal, but I'll look it up tomorrow to see if I can remove it. Then, I can go back to adding the map to the new upgraded website.
