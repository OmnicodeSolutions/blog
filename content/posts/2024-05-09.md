Today is Thursday, day 130 of 366 (35.51%). We're in week 19 of 52 (36.53%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] [Finish toggle language button](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/website/issues/101)

## Activities executed

Today I was able to get the language selector running perfectly. I started with a deeper research on the `history.push` method and found out it's deprecated and was replaced by the `navigate` method in `react-router-dom` v6 (which is the most recent one and the one I'm using). To use it, you have to do something like this:

```js
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom" //install it with npm i react-router-dom

const navigate = useNavigate()

navigate("/your/path")
```

Your component (or some parent component) has to be wrapped with a router component, I just wrapped `index.js` in a `BrowserRouter`. At first, it wasn't working properly: the URL changed but the page wouldn't automatically reload, so it would end up staying the same. I tried to find an answer to this, but couldn't find any solution that would work, so I just used `window.location.reload()` after calling `navigate`. To make sure that selecting the same language the site is already on doesn't reload the page for no reason I just moved everything into a separate function and added an `if` clause. I also made a function to return the right flag based on the current language, so that the default will always be right. In the end, this was what I needed:

```js
// Options array
const langOptions = [
    { value: 'lang1', label: <img src={lang1img} alt="usa flag" width="40" /> }, // lang1img is the name you used on the image import
    { value: 'lang2', label: <img src={lang2img} alt="brazil flag" width="40" /> }
  ]

// Handle language selection function
const handleLangChange = selectedLang => {
    if (lang !== selectedLang.value){
        navigate("/" + selectedLang.value + originalPath);
        window.location.reload();
    }
}

// Get right flag function
function selectFlag(language){
    switch(language) {
        case 'lang1':
        return lang1img
        case 'lang2':
        return lang2img
        default:
        return lang1img
    }
}

// Select component
<Select
    defaultValue={{value: lang, label: <img src={selectFlag(lang)} alt={lang + " flag"} width="40" />}} // lang comes from gatsby-theme-intl's usePageContext
    onChange={handleLangChange}
    options={langOptions}
    unstyled
    isSearchable={false}
/>
```

## Learnings

Today I learned that you can add the `unstyled` prop to the `Select` component to disable the default styles. You can also set the `isSearchable` prop to `false` if you want to disable searching for an option.
