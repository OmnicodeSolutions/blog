Today is Monday, day 127 of 366 (34.69%). We're in week 19 of 52 (36.53%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] [Finish translating the website](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/website/issues/101)

## Activities executed

Today I was almost able to finish translating the whole website, all that's left are the services and legal makdown pages, which will all be althered at once by altering the templates. However, the home page is already 100% translated and everything seems to work just fine.

## Learnings

Today I just used `useTranslations()` as explanined last week
