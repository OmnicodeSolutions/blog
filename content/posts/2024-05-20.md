Today is Monday, day 141 of 366 (38.52%). We're in week 21 of 52 (40.38%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] [Fix any issues with the database model](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/scanspend/issues/1)
- [x] [Get started on Blog renovations](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/issues/182)

## Activities executed

Today I fixed a couple of things with the database model; basically, I added IDs to everything and used relations. After that, I started some research on how to use OpenAI to automate translating the blog since this would save me a lot of time daily.

It seemed quite simple as I was reading about it, so once Mauricio gave me the API key, I started working on a Python script. OpenAI has a very good tutorial on how to do exactly what I want, and what you have to do is:

1. Set your key as `OPENAI_API_KEY` in a `.env` file.

2. Install the OpenAI library with `pip install --upgrade openai`.

3. Ask ChatGPT to translate something:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-4",
  messages=[
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You will be provided with a sentence in English, and your task is to translate it into French."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "My name is Jane. What is yours?"
    }
  ],
  temperature=0.7,
  max_tokens=64,
  top_p=1
)
```

By default, `OpenAI()` uses the key saved in the `.env` file as `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and that's where I'm getting this error:

```bash
➜  worklog-luisa git:(automate_translation) ✗ /home/omnicoder/.asdf/shims/python3.11 /home/omnicoder/Repositories/github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/worklog-luisa/translate

    raise OpenAIError(
openai.OpenAIError: The api_key client option must be set either by passing api_key to the client or by setting the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
```

It's probably just something I forgot to do, so I can definitely get it working tomorrow.

## Learnings

Today I learned that you can use OpenAI's API to do all sorts of things in either `Python`, `Node.js`, or `curl`. Here's the [official examples list](https://platform.openai.com/examples).
