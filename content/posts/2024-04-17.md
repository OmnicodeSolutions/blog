Today is Wednesday, day 108 of 366 (29.50%). We're in week 16 of 52 (30.76%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] [Add the website's content to new Gatsby project](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/website/issues/131)

## Activities executed

Today I continued to copy the content from the website into the new Gatsby project. I was able to solve yesterday's problem; it turns out I needed another plugin called `gatsby-transformer-sharp`, and I needed to put both `gatsby-transformer-sharp` and `gatsby-plugin-sharp` in the `plugins` array in `gatsby-config.js`.

After I fixed that, I went ahead and copied the `index` page. I had to install a bunch of other plugins to get past the first few errors, but that's when the bigger problems began. Gatsby is throwing an unknown error about `remark` when it tries to compile the page's HTML:

```bash
 ERROR  UNKNOWN

Truncated page data information for the failed page "/": {
  "errors": {},
  "path": "/",
  "slicesMap": {},
  "pageContext": {}
}

failed Building static HTML for pages - 2.154s

 ERROR #95313  HTML.COMPILATION

See our docs page for more info on this error: https://gatsby.dev/debug-html

  12 |   function createMarkup(data) {
  13 |     const dataHtml = toHTML(data)


  WebpackError: TypeError: (0 , remark.default) is not a function
```

I read a little about remark, but couldn't figure out what these are.
