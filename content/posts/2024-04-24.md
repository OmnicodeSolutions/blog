Today is Wednesday, day 115 of 366 (31.42%). We're in week 17 of 52 (32.69%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] Adjust map configuration
- [x] Adjust page layout

## Activities executed

Today I 100% finished the map. I was able to put in the right coordinates and customize the page correctly, including making it responsive. This last part is what took most of my morning, but I was able to figure out the CSS eventually.

I also fixed Node's version on the GitHub action, and Mauricio helped me solve the peer dependency error that was making me use `--force` when installing anything with `npm`:

```bash
npm ERR! code ERESOLVE

```

This made it possible for the action to run `npm ci`, but it still fails on `npm run lint`:

```bash
npm ERR! Missing script: "lint"
npm ERR!
npm ERR! Did you mean this?
npm ERR!     npm link # Symlink a package folder

```

Tomorrow I'll work on that, and I'll start working on the website translation after.
