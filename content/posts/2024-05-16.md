Today is Thursday, day 137 of 366 (37.43%). We're in week 20 of 52 (38.46%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] [Make architectural suggestion for Scanspend](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/scanspend/issues/3)
- [ ] [Fix any issues with the database model](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/scanspend/issues/1)

## Activities executed

Today I did a lot of research to choose between [Deno](https://deno.com/) and [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and ultimately went for Deno because I was able to find more information on what I needed. I also made an [architecture suggestion](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/scanspend/blob/011679445a2c0b584ef52e095bd91870421c0829/docs/typescriptApp.md?plain=1#L69) for Scanspend. I'm not sure if it's complete, but what I researched the most, other than the runtime, was the MVC framework.

Since the TypeScript app I studied used NestJS, I went straight to it, but it doesn't seem to be compatible with Deno. However, I found [DestJS](https://deno.land/x/destjs@v0.2.0), which is a NestJS-inspired framework for Deno. I didn't want to use the first one I found, so I did some more research and found [Mandarine.TS](https://deno.land/x/mandarinets@v2.3.2) and [Knight](https://deno.land/x/knight@2.3.0). The first one was hard to find any documentation on, but I did like the second one a lot because it seems really easy to use. I really don't know which one I want to use, but I put DestJS in the suggestion since it was based on NestJS.

Mauricio didn't get a chance to look at the database model I made, so there wasn't anything to fix.
