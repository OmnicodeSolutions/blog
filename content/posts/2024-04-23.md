Today is Tuesday, day 114 of 366 (31.14%). We're in week 17 of 52 (32.69%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] [Add a map to Omnicode's website](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/website/issues/128)

## Activities executed

Today, I successfully added the map to the website. I couldn't do it by following the [first tutorial I found](https://www.andrewl.net/article/gatsby-geo-simple-map); I kept getting this error:

```bash
ERROR #95312

"window" is not available during server-side rendering. Enable "DEV_SSR" to debug this during "gatsby%0D%0Adevelop".%0D%0A
```

I tried doing some research to see if there was a way of fixing it, but I couldn't find anything that worked.

After that, I decided to look up the Leaflet plugin and ended up on [Gatsby's documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-react-leaflet/), which had a little tutorial on how to add a map. I followed the steps from there, and it worked. I adjusted it a little so that it was its own component and changed some variables to be passed as props.

I still have to adjust the map on the page so that it looks like the [inspiration](https://soloist.ai/omnicodesolutions) and get the right coordinates in it.
