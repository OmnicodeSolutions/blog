Today is Wednesday, day 136 of 366 (37.15%). We're in week 20 of 52 (38.46%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] [Make database model](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/scanspend/issues/1)

## Activities executed

Today I worked on making a database model for [Scanspend](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/scanspend). I've never done this before, so there's probably a lot of things wrong with it that I'll fix tomorrow.

## Learnings

In order to make the database model, I studied the NFCe's `html` and found out that every item purchased is inside a `<table>` tag and looks something like this:

```html
<tr id="Item + 1">
    <td valign="top">
        <span class="txtTit">SUCO DELI ABACAXI 300ML</span>
        <span class="RCod">(Código: 907)</span>
        <br>
        <span class="Rqtd">
        <strong>Qtde.:</strong>1</span>
        <span class="RUN">
        <strong>UN: </strong>UN</span>
        <span class="RvlUnit">
        <strong>Vl. Unit.:</strong>&nbsp;5</span>
    </td>
    <td align="right" valign="top" class="txtTit noWrap">Vl. Total<br><span class="valor">5,00</span></td>
</tr>
```

Which means getting information from it shouldn't be hard at all. The total might be a little trickier to get directly from the `html`, since it looks something like this:

```html
<div id="totalNota" class="txtRight">
    <!-- ... -->
    <div id="linhaTotal" class="linhaShade">
        <label>Valor a pagar R$:</label>
        <span class="totalNumb txtMax">37,99</span>
    </div>
    <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

So it might be easier to just get the individual prices and quantities and do some math.
