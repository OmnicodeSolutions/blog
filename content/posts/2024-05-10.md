Today is Friday, day 131 of 366 (35.79%). We're in week 19 of 52 (36.53%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] [Start research for the tax invoice project](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/scanspend/issues/1)

## Activities executed

Today I did some research on libraries to handle tax invoices; they are all [here](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/scanspend/blob/libraries/libraries.md). I looked up Dart ones and found one that handles `xml` files, but nothing specific to tax invoices. I also found a few Python ones, and a couple of them are specific to what I need, but maybe even too specific.

After I couldn't find any new ones, I tried to look up how to download the `xml` file for the tax invoice, and apparently I can't, which means half of those libraries are useless. But I'll have to dig a little deeper into this matter.
