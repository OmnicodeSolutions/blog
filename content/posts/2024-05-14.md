Today is Tuesday, day 135 of 366 (36.88%). We're in week 20 of 52 (38.46%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] [Study architecture of apps](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/scanspend/issues/3)

## Activities executed

Today I did some more research on the [backend technologies from the TypeScript app](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/scanspend/blob/67e28fd245298c898b78926c2b9c4e81e1fdc703/docs/typescriptApp.md?plain=1#L3). I also reached the conclusion that I can't have the `xml` file for the tax invoices, so I'll be parsing the `html` to gather data, that made me go look for more libraries and I found [`axios`](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro), which can get the page's `html` froma giver `url`. Apparently it works well with Deno, but not with Bun, which may be important since me and Mauricio decided we're going to stick to TypeScript and use Prisma, but we'll go for either Deno or Bun instead of Node. Since this is already decided, tomorrow, when I make the database model I can make the code already using Prisma's syntax in the source code.
