Today is Wednesday, day 143 of 366 (39.07%). We're in week 21 of 52 (40.38%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] [Automate Blog translation](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/issues/182)

## Activities executed

Today I finished automating the blog translation, which means that now I can just run some [python code](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/blob/38099630fb987877e971cffb4e68e18cf8058579/translate.py#L1C1-L43C16) and everything gets translated for me. 

I also started studying a bit more about AI so that I can use it to make a summary of all the blog entries that will be my internship report, there's more about this is the next sections.

## Learnings

Today I learned about training GPT on specific documents to make a custom AI powered bot, from what I've learned, the first thing to do is create an embedding of the documents. You can use OpenAI's own tools, there's some good [official documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings) on it, but what I'm going to use is [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/introduction/), which provides tools for both embedding and training GPT, aside from a lot others. 

## Readings

1. [Langchain Javascript Coding Tutorial | Getting Started | Node.js Quickstart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAnf6PPnvLg):
shows a nice example on how to use Langchain in TypeScript, but I want to do mine in in python.

2. [Langchain JS | How to Use GPT-3, GPT-4 to Reference your own Data | OpenAI Embeddings Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veV2I-NEjaM):
talks about embedding with Langchain.

3. [GPT-4 Tutorial: How to Chat With Multiple PDF Files (~1000 pages of Tesla's 10-K Annual Reports)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix9WIZpArm0):
talks about the logic behind "talking" to multiple PDFs, I don't think the logic for "talking" to multiple text files is much different.

4. [Vector databases are so hot right now. WTF are they?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klTvEwg3oJ4):
quick explanation on vector databases

5. [OpenAI Embeddings and Vector Databases Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySus5ZS0b94):
really nice embedding tutorial
