Today is Friday, day 117 of 366 (31.96%). We're in week 17 of 52 (32.69%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] [Make website multilingual](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/website/issues/101)
- [x] [Update GitHub actions](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/website/issues/135)

## Activities executed

Today I started by fixing the GitHub Actions checkout action version to v4, so that could fix these warnings:

```bash
build (20.x)
Node.js 16 actions are deprecated. Please update the following actions to use Node.js 20: actions/checkout@v2. For more information see: https://github.blog/changelog/2023-09-22-github-actions-transitioning-from-node-16-to-node-20/.
```

that were showing up when the action ran.

After that, I went back to setting up the website's translation. I reset the WIP commit from yesterday and committed a few things, but I must have messed something up in the middle because I started getting an error with GraphQL. I tried removing the `node_modules` directory and run `npm i`, but I kept getting the same error. I got a little scared that the same error was happening in the developer branch, so I went to check, and everything was fine. I replaced the files from `feat/translation` that were giving me the error with the same ones from `develop` to see if maybe I messed something up in them, but I kept getting the same error. After a while, I decided to just go back to the tutorial and redo yesterday's path to see if maybe something I did in the `gatsby-*.js` files was causing it, and apparently it was because after I redid everything, I went back to yesterday's `lang` error:

```bash
 ERROR #95313  HTML.COMPILATION

Building static HTML failed for path "/legal/privacy-policy/"

See our docs page for more info on this error: https://gatsby.dev/debug-html


   6 | export const PageContextProvider = ({ pageContext, children }) => {
   7 |   const { i18n } = useTranslation();
>  8 |   i18n.changeLanguage(pageContext.lang);
     |                                   ^
   9 |
  10 |   return <PageContext.Provider value={pageContext}>{children}</PageContext.Provider>;
  11 | };


  WebpackError: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'lang')
```

which I haven't been able to fix yet.
