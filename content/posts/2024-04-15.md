Today is Monday, day 106 of 366 (28.96%). We're in week 16 of 52 (30.76%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] [Add a map to Omnicode's website](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/website/issues/128)

## Activities executed

Today I tried upgrading to Gatsby v5, just to try everything before starting from scratch, but it didn't work. I am following [Mauricio's instructions](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/website/issues/131) to rebuild the website with new NodeJS, NPM, and Gatsby. I'm having some trouble with the syncing part, but I'm sure I'll figure it out.

## Learnings

Today I learned how to install Gatsby CLI and create a new project with:

```bash
npm install -g gatsby-cli
gatsby new
```

I also learned how to set NodeJS and NPM in the `engines` section of the `package.json` file and ensure that npm commands such as `npm install` will fail if the required engine versions do not match. All you have to do is add a `.npmrc` file and set `engine-strict` to `true`.
