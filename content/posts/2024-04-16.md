Today is Tuesday, day 107 of 366 (29.23%). We're in week 16 of 52 (30.76%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] [Update Gatsby](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/website/issues/131)

## Activities executed

Today I created the new Gatsby project with a newer version of Gatsby, NodeJS, and NPM. I started moving all the information from the website and adding plugins as I need (also newer versions).

The first thing that broke was `gatsby-plugin-google-gtag` because now it needs some configuration in `gatsby-config.js`, this is from the [Gatsby documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-google-gtag/):

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-google-gtag`,
      options: {
        // You can add multiple tracking ids and a pageview event will be fired for all of them.
        trackingIds: [
          "GA-TRACKING_ID", // Google Analytics / GA
          "AW-CONVERSION_ID", // Google Ads / Adwords / AW
          "DC-FLOODIGHT_ID", // Marketing Platform advertising products (Display & Video 360, Search Ads 360, and Campaign Manager)
        ],
        // This object gets passed directly to the gtag config command
        // This config will be shared across all trackingIds
        gtagConfig: {
          optimize_id: "OPT_CONTAINER_ID",
          anonymize_ip: true,
          cookie_expires: 0,
        },
        // This object is used for configuration specific to this plugin
        pluginConfig: {
          // Puts tracking script in the head instead of the body
          head: false,
          // Setting this parameter is also optional
          respectDNT: true,
          // Avoids sending pageview hits from custom paths
          exclude: ["/preview/**", "/do-not-track/me/too/"],
          // Defaults to https://www.googletagmanager.com
          origin: "YOUR_SELF_HOSTED_ORIGIN",
          // Delays processing pageview events on route update (in milliseconds)
          delayOnRouteUpdate: 0,
        },
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

Mauricio helped me find the ID it needed in the current website, but after I added it, it was still not working, so I removed the plugin from `package.json`, ran `npm i` to remove it, added it again, and ran the same command to reinstall it, and it worked.

After that, I moved in the components and a second error arose:

```bash
ERROR #85908  GRAPHQL.VALIDATION

There was an error in your GraphQL query:

The fragment "GatsbyImageSharpFluid" does not exist.

   7 |  * images with lazy loading and reduced file sizes. The image is loaded using a
   8 |  * `useStaticQuery`, which allows us to load the image from directly within this
   9 |  * component, rather than having to pass the image data down from pages.

I looked it up and found an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/20984). Apparently, a lot of people were having this problem with Gatsby v2, but it was supposed to be fixed. Eventually, I found someone saying that they had forgotten `gatsby-plugin-sharp`, so I installed it, but it still doesn't work. I'll try doing the same thing I did for `gatsby-plugin-google-gtag` tomorrow.
