Today is Friday, day 103 of 366 (28.14%). We're in week 15 of 52 (28.84%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] [Add a map to Omnicode's website](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/website/issues/128)

## Activities executed

Today I tried to fix the error with the Leaflet map plugin. First, I attempted to reinstall it, but it didn't work. So, I conducted a little research and came across [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70941127/gatsby-plugin-react-leaflet-with-gatsby-v3-build-error#:~:text=It%20should%20be,of%20MapContainer%20wrapper.) on Stack Overflow, which suggests that it's a version issue that was resolved with Node 14.x. The problem is, I can't use a higher version of Node because then I have to use a higher version of npm, and that's not compatible with the current Gatsby version I'm using. Therefore, I tried upgrading Gatsby.

I went to the Gatsby documentation and found [this tutorial to migrate from v2 to v3](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v2-to-v3/). I attempted to follow it, but since Gatsby is already on v5, I couldn't figure out what version I had to use for each plugin.

Tomorrow, I'm going to try to upgrade all the way to v5, but I think it's going to be easier to just start a new Gatsby project with everything in the latest version and then migrate the content from the current site to that.
